# description

### Our project is primarily concerned with criminal cases.
### As we all know, there are numerous issues concerning this topic in our country.Normally, no one answers the phone at the police station.Or it  isn't working properly.As a direct consequence, crimes do not receive a resolution.
### Email is the most commonly used connection method in our project.because email is the creedable one.As a result, if a person exposed to a crime, he or she can report it using our system, which allows them to respond quickly And there will be no information lag.
### Furthermore, crimes can be easily fixed because police officers will arrive to the crime scene on time and collect evidence.Even if transparency and accountability are demonstrated because the email notification is visible to the police officers.
### Adiss Abeba is the scope of our project for testing. In our project, the police station and residents will sign up using the signup page. and we will store the registered data in a SQL database.
